# Nebula Game Engine
Nebula is a lightweight python/pygame-based game engine made mostly as a one person passion project.
**DISCLAIMER**: Nebula is still early in development, so a lot of basic features are missing :>
# Features

- loading and scaling sprites
- loading and playing animations / animated sprites
- custom UI library
